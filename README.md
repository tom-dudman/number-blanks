# Number Blanks

Embarrassingly, I found myself unable to answer my 10-year-old's maths homework problem.

I decided I needed practice, so I created this app to generate problems for me to solve.

## Development

After pulling the repo, run:

```shell
npm install
```

To start local development, run:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Once you've finished, run:

```shell
npm run build
```

And test the production locally with:

```shell
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

Open a PR into `main`. Once it's merged, it'll get deployed automatically.
